## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Advantages:
Agile has Faster feedback, is adaptable to changes and higher customer satisfaction.
Waterfall has a Well-defined structure, clear documentation,and is good for predictable projects.
Disadvantages:
Agile is Harder to estimate costs and timelines and requires high client involvement.
Waterfall is Inflexible to changes and issues are detected late in the process.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial for Dynamic projects with evolving requirements, Startups developing MVPs where feedback is critical and Software with frequent updates. while waterfall is more beneficial for Projects with fixed requirements, Government contracts where documentation is required and Large-scale infrastructure projects
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Some methods for ensuring quality standards include: Unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and Automated testing to detect defects early. it is iomportant because it Reduces bugs and improves reliability, Enhances user experience and security and Prevents costly rework after deployment.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope helps set clear objectives, avoid scope creep, and ensure that all stakeholders have aligned expectations.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical breakdown of project deliverables into manageable sections.
